## Welcome to the matrix server list
This repository is intended to build a curated list of public matrix servers that are free to sign up at and use. Joining one of these servers will help the network to be more decentral and have more people spread around. While there is no guarantee for these servers to remain online it will be at your own risk for joining one of these.

## Want to have your own server added?
Whenever you are running your own server you can have your server added this without a hassle. Simply open an issue on this Github repository and provide us the information that should be added to the list. Also your listing will be added to [matrixservers.net](https://matrixservers.net) in the future
since this website is still in development I have created this repository instead.

## Matrix Server List
Hopefully this will help you to find your perfect new home within the matrix network and a place to call home.
